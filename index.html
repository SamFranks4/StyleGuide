    <h2>Welcome to the Style Guide</h2>

    <p>A style guide is a set of rules and guidelines that helps writers keep their work consistent in tone, formatting, and structure. It ensures that all written content looks professional, follows proper grammar, and maintains a clear voice. Style guides are commonly used for research papers, articles, and organizational documents to make sure everything aligns with a standard approach.</p>

    <p>When working with AI to generate text, a style guide is especially helpful. By providing the AI with a clear set of instructions, you can make sure the output matches the tone, sentence structure, and formatting you want. This makes the AI-generated content more reliable and professional, reducing the amount of editing you need to do.</p>

    <p>For example, if your style guide specifies using Times New Roman, size 12, with 1.5 line spacing and 4–7 sentence paragraphs, you can instruct the AI to follow those rules. The AI can then create content that closely follows your style, and you simply check for accuracy and consistency. This makes producing high-quality research papers much faster and easier.</p>
